<p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest 
    types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can
    also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers 
    of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, 
    nd seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, 
    which becomes melted during baking. 
    Typically cooked pasta is assembled with 
    the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. 
    The resulting baked pasta is cut into 
    single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
